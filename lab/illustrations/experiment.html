    <p class='introduction'>잊을 수 없는 추억으로 이 그림들을 그렸습니다…</p><p class='description'>This set of 6 illustrations reflect memories of time I spent in Seoul, South Korea. <br/>They are rendered in a brutalist style, in reference to the many examples of this style found throughout the city. Seoul's neighborhoods all have their distinct atmosphere, but city-wide, the landscape is a mix of fiery mercantilism, efficient brutalism and a brand of cuteness slightly darker and meatier than Japan's. Let's not forget the night-time version, a much more livable version of Blade Runner's.</p><figure id='자일단한잔'><div class='image'></div><figcaption>자 일단 한잔 – First, let's have a drink (2018). <br />Soju is most consumed alcohol worldwide, and nearly all of it is drunk in South Korea. When meeting a close friend not seen in a long time, it is good manners to offer to go for a drink. You will probably sit around a round metal table, eat something greasy, spicy and sweet, and down a few green bottles before morning comes up.</figcaption></figure><figure id='남산타워'><div class='image'></div><figcaption>남산 타워 – Seoul Tower (2018) <br/> Seoul is 6 times the size of Paris and 10 times more populated than the City of Lights, but some say it lacks a world famous landmark <i>à la Tour Eiffel</i>. If there was one such landmark, it would be the tower sitting on top of Mount Namsan now officially known as N Seoul Tower, whilst Seoulites call it Namsan Tower. Whatever you call it, just like the Eiffel Tower, the locals rarely climb it, but the city would not be itself without it.</figcaption></figure><figure id='홍대입구'><div class='image'></div><figcaption>홍대입구역 – Hongdae Station (2018) <br/>Hongik University, also known as Hongdae, gives its name to the most popular area for Seoul's numerous youth brigades to spen their part-time jobs' wages. Any day after 5pm, hordes of smartly dressed teenagers and former teenagers alike climb up and run down the area's hills hunting the next hot trend.</figcaption></figure><figure id='양화대교'><div class='image'></div><figcaption>양화대교 – Yangwha Bridge (2018) <br/>Yangwha Bridge is the way back from Hongdae to the area I spent most time in, Yeongdeungpo-gu. Metro Line 2 crosses the river parralel to it, and while taking the metro in the early morning, I often looked at the sun rise over the bridge.</figcaption></figure><figure id='나도달만생각해'><div class='image'></div><figcaption>나도 달만 생각해 – I, too, only think about the moon (2018) <br/>In Insadong, there are many tea houses. One of them is special for the number of memories I have there. Like teas served in this house, some of these memories are bitter and some are sweet.</figcaption></figure><figure id='x1313호'><div class='image'></div><figcaption>1313호 – Apartment 1313 (2018) <br/> My old place.</figcaption></figure><p>If you want to see more of Seoul's aesthetics, check out this video by <a href='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW0xtgBQO_ODfDCMCi8n14g' target='blank'>DoStuff</a> : <div class='video'><iframe width='100% height='448 src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/6dAz7Golf-U' frameborder='0' allow='autoplay; encrypted-media' allowfullscreen></iframe></div></p>
