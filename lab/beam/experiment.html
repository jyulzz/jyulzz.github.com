I am developing this application to broaden my understanding of app development, and incrementally improve its usability to broaden my UX skills. </em> </p> <p> Having the privilege of working as a UX designer within highly qualified teams, I know and benefit from the value of labor specialisation everyday. Each member brings skills that they have fine-tuned for years and sometimes decades, and in 99% of cases —I don't believe in absolutes!— it is wiser to let them tackle their share of the project in the ways they think best. </p> <p> That being said, there's <em class='deleted'>nothing wrong</em> everything right in giving a go at other's domains, in emergency and edge cases at work, but more so on your own time. </p> <p> I have always enjoyed building projects to see both how far I can go in domains I don't know as much about as my primary focuses, and measure the limits I have compared to my colleagues in their respective domains of expertise. </p> <p> 2 years ago I built a project to play with <a href='https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial' target='blank'>Google's JavaScript Maps API </a>. As any APIs released by a behemoth company, it is both extensive and highly reliable, thanks to its use by millions of developers in thousands of different ways. It seemed like a good base to challenge myself in learning technologies I was curious about. </p> <p> For lack of time then, I ended up building a prototype in vanilla Javascript with some jQuery sprinkles, using <a href='https://www.npmjs.com/package/foundation-sites' target='blank'>Zurb's Foundation NPM package</a> as a base for the HTML views and SCSS stylesheets. </p> <p> Recently, I rebuilt this prototype with cleaner code in preparation for a project I codenamed Beam. </p> <h2> The Plan </h2> <p> This project's name, Beam, is a metaphor for the path of knowledge I want to build for myself through its improvement and porting to different technologies and platforms. </p> <p> It has no immediate commercial purposes, but I have a roadmap of where I want to take it in the coming months: <ul> <li> Version 0 — First build (November 2016): At this point this project was one of many I built, its specificity was its focus on using an established public API. </li> <li> Version 1 — Second build (Sep 2018): Upon deciding to extend this project through more versions, I decided to clean up its code and build a basic version to serve as a solid foundation for the next steps. </li> <li> Version 2 — Third build : Porting of the project to <a href='https://reactjs.org/' target='blank'>ReactJS</a>. ReactJS has come to be the dominant JS application framework and looks set to keep ahead of the pack in the next few years. I have dabbled with simple views written with it, I am curious to see how much of it I can learn through rebuilding the project using it. </li> <li> Version 3 — Desktop version : Creation of a desktop version using <a href='http://electron.atom.io/' target='blank'>ElectronJS</a>. Another technology that has caught my eye 1 or 2 years ago is ElectronJS, a side project of the GitHub team who has blessed the world with Atom.io. It allows the transformation of web applications into desktop ones (.app for Mac, .exe for Windows, etc...). I can't wait to see what I can make with it. </li> </ul> </p> <p> Versions have a defined goal to make them manageable and focus my thinking on delivering solid builds. They don't have set dates, although that would be a nice additional challenge, but this is a side project and I don't want to either focus too much time on it in detriment of my day-to-day productions, and conversely feel demotivated if I fall behind on a rigid schedule. It seems healthier and ultimately more productive to rely on internal motivation here. </p> <h2> What does this have to do with UX? </h2> <p> Each major version will have several minor ones, mostly to do with improvements from a UX perspective. </p> </section> </section>
