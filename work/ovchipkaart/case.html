      <h2>Context</h2>
      <section class='sub'>
        <p>All public transport in the Netherlands can be accessed using a contactless card called <em class='brand'>OV Chipkaart</em><sup><a href='#note1' data-smooth-scroll data-offset='80' class='scroll discreet'>1</a></sup>  ("<i>Openbaar Vervoer Chipkaart</i>, meaning public transport chipcard"). </p>
        <p>This card can be used by travelers to pay for their journey by spending credit they loaded onto it and/or as a support for subscriptions with various public transport operators.</p>
        <p>Most operations on the card require the use of automated machines that can be found in nearly all public transport stations and other service points, including supermarkets.</p>
        <p>A mobile phone application is available as well, allowing users to access basic information about their cards, find customer service centers and query a Help/FAQ database.</p>
        <p>However, this application was last updated in 2016 for its iOS version and in June 2017 for its Android version. It is rated 1.7/5 by 157 users on the Apple App Store and 3.1/5 by 2,857 users in the Google Play Store. The feature sets differ between the iOS and Android versions, wihth the latter having extra features such as credit top-up, but these are poorly implemented.</p><p>A complete analysis and evaluation of the application and its usage are needed to see how it can be made relevant to users again.</p>

      <h2>Process</h2>
      <section class='sub'>
        <h3>Research</h3>
        <p>
          I interviewed in-person 31 public transport users in Den Haag Centraal station on January 20th, 2018 between 14:00 and 20:00. I questioned them on their knowledge and usage of the current <em class='brand'>OV Chipkaart</em> application : <ul><li>only 41.9% of respondents were aware of the existence of the app,</li><li>out of the 58.1% of users unaware of the existence of the app, 72.2% were interested in trying the app,</li><li>of the respondents aware of the existence of the app, 38.5% had uninstalled the application at the time of the survey, with 6 out of 10 listing the poor quality of the application and 4 out of 10 their lack of use of the application as reasons to remove it from their phone,</li><li>in active users, 61.6% had used it within the current month and another 23.1% within the current year,</li><li>users rated the application 2.31/5 on average, with 61.6% of users rating the application either 1/5 or 2/5,</li><li>92.3% of users agreed they might use the application more if it had new useful features, 100% of these same users asked for the ability to add credit to their <em class='brand'>OV Chipkaart</em> from the application and 66.7% asked to be able to use the application to show their card to control officers when they are checked while on public transport.</li></ul><p>Results show that the <em class='brand'>OV Chipkaart</em> application suffers from a lack of awareness of its existence within the general public. The application’s quality and usefulness are rated poorly. Most surveyed would be willing to try the application or use it more if it had more useful features. The 2 most requested features are the ability to add credit to an <em class='brand'>OV Chipkaart</em> from the application, and the virtualization of the card, allowing users to show their card to controllers and other staff on their phone’s screen.</p>
        </p>
        <h3>Discovery</h3>
        <p>
          I created this extensive flowchart of the current version of the application: <figure id='flowchart-old' class=''><div class='image'></div><figcaption>Flowchart for the current version of the application.</figcaption></figure>
        </p>
        <h3>Planning</h3>
        <p>
          Based on the input from the Research and Discovery phases, I created an updated flowchart reflecting changes in the features set and navigation patterns: <figure id='flowchart-new' class=''><div class='image'></div><figcaption>Updated flowchart for new version of the application. Changed sections are highlighted in green.</figcaption></figure>The changes are, from top to bottom and left to right:<ol><li>integration of the sign-up form into the application for a smoother experience,</li><li>removal of the Feedback section in favor of a feedback pop-up, reducing the function’s footprint in the navigation (this pop-up should be displayed after the application has been open for example 5 times, to let the user first form an opinion before asking for feedback),</li><li>renaming Travel history to Trips, Card information to Cards, Service points to Stores, using simpler and more relatable terms,</li><li>addition of a credit top-up function in the Cards section, freeing the user from the constraints of using physical machines for this action,</li><li>addition of QR codes on the cards, allowing for dematerialized scanning by controlling officers and other staff members, which solves issues of users forgetting theirs card or not finding them when needed,</li><li>addition of email, WhatsApp and phone contact information option in the Help section, formerly titled Questions and answers, as users now expect to have a wide range of choices to contact service providers in the same way they reach out to friends,</li><li>creation of a Profile section, combining elements of the former Settings section and including a user avatar to increase personal investment of users' in their experience of the app.</li></ol>
        </p>
        <h3>Production</h3>
        <p>
          Here are the main screens of the application, old version on the left, new version on the right : <figure id='trips-screen' class=' comparaison'><div class='image'></div><div class='image'></div><figcaption>Old version of the Trips screen</figcaption><figcaption>New version of the Trips screen</figcaption></figure> <figure id='cards-screen' class=' comparaison'><div class='image'></div><div class='image'></div><figcaption>Old version of the Cards screen</figcaption><figcaption>New version of the Cards screen</figcaption></figure> <figure id='card-details-screen' class=' comparaison'><div class='image'></div><div class='image'></div><figcaption>Old version of the Card details screen</figcaption><figcaption>New version of the Card details screen</figcaption></figure> <figure id='stores-screen' class=' comparaison'><div class='image'></div><div class='image'></div><figcaption>Old version of the Stores screen</figcaption><figcaption>New version of the Stores screen</figcaption></figure> <figure id='help-screen' class=' comparaison'><div class='image'></div><div class='image'></div><figcaption>Old version of the Help screen</figcaption><figcaption>New version of the Help screen</figcaption></figure> <figure id='profile-screen' class=' comparaison'><div class='image'></div><div class='image'></div><figcaption>Old version of the Profile screen</figcaption><figcaption>New version of the Profile screen</figcaption></figure></p><p>New screens were added :  <figure id='card-topup' class=''><div class='image'></div><figcaption>Card top-up screen</figcaption></figure></p>

      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <section class='sub'>
        <p>
          Improving the <em class='brand'>OV Chipkaart</em> application and promoting its relaunch is the most efficient way to raise the number of active users. For the 5 companies participating in the <em class='brand'>OV Chipkaart</em> system, this helps reduce the use of their physical machines, personnels and contact centers, while providing better services to users by allowing them to perform tasks from their phones, from any location and at any time. This results in lower operational costs as well as an improvement of profitability and their image in the general public.
