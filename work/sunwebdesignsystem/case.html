      <section class='sub'>
        <p>The <a id='note1-origin' href='#note1' data-smooth-scroll data-offset='80' class='scroll discreet note origin'><em class='brand'>Sunweb Group</em><sup>1</sup></a> is an organization operating 14 tourism brands in 10 European countries.</p>
        <p>Across 7 main offices, over 500 people collaborate to build products for each of the group's brands, using a wide range of tools, methods, systems and languages.</p>
        <p>In Q2 2017, the UX team in Amsterdam, Netherlands (of which I was a part of) and a Front-end Development team in Girona, Spain started a conversation on issues faced in keeping product designs consistent using current workflows.</p>
        <p>Our shared pain point was that without a common, comprehensive and up-to-date style reference, it was difficult to build a consistent user experience across the wide range of products offered to customers under each brand.</p>
        <p>A related concern was the productivity lost in correcting discrepancies in designs between products and in searching for design elements without a clear source to work from.</p>
        <p>It quickly became clear that offering everyone in the company access to a Syleguide-type resource documenting each brand’s visual properties and product components would be the most efficient way to improve both the quality of products for final users and our productivity.</p>

      <h2>Process</h2>
      <section class='sub'>
        <h3>Research</h3>
        <p>
          3 rounds of brainstorming sessions were held between the 2 founding teams, focused on the vision, the principles of execution and the objectives of the project.</p><p>I scheduled and lead additional meetings with Marketing and Creative department members to discuss their needs in terms of content to be included in the Styleguide (e.g: the Creative Department asked for video resources to be included in brand assets, such as TV idents to be used in commercials).
        </p>
        <h3>Planning</h3>
        <p>
          Based on research input, essential features needed to produce an <a id='note3-origin' href='#note3' data-smooth-scroll data-offset='80' class='scroll discreet note origin'>MVP<sup>3</sup></a> were shortlisted.</p><p>The Design System should: <ol><li>be accessible by anyone in the company,</li><li>contain all style elements for each of the brands, with at minimum : Foundations, Material Elements, Color Schemes, Components and Media Resources,</li><li>be consumable through an <a href='#note4' id='note4-origin' data-smooth-scroll data-offset='80' class='scroll discreet note origin'>API<sup>4</sup></a>, allowing more rapid product development and integrations into other systems within the company.</li></ol>
        </p>
        <h3>Production</h3>
        <p>
          We started designing the first wireframes, sharing them with developers and other future users of the system.</p><p>After a first round of comments, I transformed the wireframes into designs using Sketch : <figure id='color-page' class=''><div class='image'></div><figcaption>Color page of the Design System, presenting brand colors, neutral colors, state colors and their variations, complete with HEX, RGB and CMYK codes</figcaption></figure> <figure id='typography-page' class=''><div class='image'></div><figcaption>Typography page of the Design System, presenting title, navigation and content text styles</figcaption></figure> <figure id='component-page' class=''><div class='image'></div><figcaption>Component page of the Design System, presenting a button component, its variations, with usage guidelines</figcaption></figure></p><p>With these first designs delivered, implementation by developers began.</p>
        </p>
        <h3>Testing</h3>
        <p>
          Successive private releases of the Design System were used in real conditions for the design of new products across the company.</p><p>The benefits were immediate, encouraging us in expanding the scope of the system and enriching it with new content.

        <p>
          Being part of such a large-scope and foundational effort is an honor. The benefits for the company are both immediate and long-term, strengthening the internal design culture as well as empowering designers, developers, marketers and everyone else with the same level of access to the visual DNA of each brand, in a format useful to all, reducing negative dependencies, clearing bottlenecks in worfklows and making everyone's job easier by sharing productive information.

Any possible linkages to this data element (possibly in other areas of the relational schema or even in distant federated databases) are by reference only. Because all other locations of the data just refer back to the primary "source of truth" location, updates to the data element in the primary location propagate to the entire system without the possibility of a duplicate value somewhere being forgotten.(...)

In general terms, it is a set of clearly defined methods of communication between various software components. A good API makes it easier to develop a computer program by providing all the building blocks, which are then put together by the programmer. An API may be for a web-based system, operating system, database system, computer hardware or software library.(...)
